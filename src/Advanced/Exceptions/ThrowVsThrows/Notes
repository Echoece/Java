throw ::
    The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
    We can throw either checked or unchecked exception.This exception i.e, Instance must be of type Throwable or a subclass of Throwable.

    The flow of execution of the program stops immediately after the throw statement is executed and the nearest
    enclosing try block is checked to see if it has a catch statement that matches the type of exception. If it finds
    a match, controlled is transferred to that statement otherwise next enclosing try block is checked and so on. If
    no matching catch is found then the default exception handler will halt the program.

    The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions. It is kind of alternate of returning from a method in
    some cases (check Exception propagation example).


throws ::
    throws is a keyword in Java which is used in the signature of method to indicate that this method might throw one
    of the listed type exceptions. The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block.

    => throws keyword is required only for checked exception and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exception is meaningless.
    => throws keyword is required only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword does not prevent abnormal termination of program.
    => By the help of throws keyword we can provide information to the caller of the method about the exception.
