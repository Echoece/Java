This is a new feature introduced in java 1.7.

Context: Context is the area of the program. For java program, stack is the context of the program.

Things like heap, mouse ,keyboard, printer, internet , hard-disk , Database etc are external to the program.
It is not part of the context. The issue is, when we use external resources, we must return it. Otherwise program
will occupy that resource and will not be available for other program use.

-> for heap area, Garbage collector automatically deallocate free memory location, so this is not required to handle by
   developers.
-> Rest of the resources, developers are responsible to close them after using. In that case we can use finally block to
   close the resources, or we can use the new java feature try with resource.
-> Here we dont need to specify the finally block to close the resource, it will be automatically closed. The catch or finally
   block is purely optional depending on our requirement.
-> try can only close the resources that implement the interface AutoClosable. It has a method close() defined there.
-> we can use multiple resources inside try with resource by separating them with semicolon.
   Example: try (FileInputStream f= new FileInputStream("a.txt"); Scanner sc= new Scanner(f); )
