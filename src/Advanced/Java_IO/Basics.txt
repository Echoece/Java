1. in short, the java program is consist of the method area and stack in the memory (RAM). So everything else is a resource to the program.
   This includes,   -> heap (where everything with new operator is stored)
                    -> keyboard (input)
                    -> monitor (output)
                    -> remote network client (can be input or output or both) etc


2. Stream: Stream is flow of data, it can flow in both direction (from program to resource or resource to program)

3. Buffer: The speed in which the program send/receive data and the resources receiving/sending data might not match. In this case
           a buffer is used. Buffer is just a memory object to hold the data, to have compatibility between devices. So for example,
           when a program want to read from a file, the content of file goes into buffer and the program consume the data from there.
           It is same for sending data from program as well. Data from program goes into buffer, and resources consume it.


4. When we want to send data or receive, the data is broken into byte of stream. Java provides lots of classes for streams.

   Byte Stream classes: here data is read one byte at a time (example, inputstream and outputstream classes).
   Character stream classes: here data is read on character (two byte) at a time (example Reader and writer classes).
