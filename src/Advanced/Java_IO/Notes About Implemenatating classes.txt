 Some notes about implementation of byte stream classes (full list is in the image in this package):

   a) Input stream classes
   -> ByteArrayInputStream : this is used when we want to work with an array of bytes

   -> FileInputStream: this is used for reading input bytes from a file system. Recommended for reading raw bytes such as image data etc.

   -> FilterInputStream: Its not designed to be used directly, its an example of Decorator design pattern. It's sub-classes we can use
            -> BufferedInputStream: it adds the ability to buffer the input, and support mark and reset methods.
            -> DataInputStream: It's used for primitive data types (like int, char etc)
            -> PushbackInputStream: it has functionality to unread one byte (essentially pushing back one byte to the stream)

   -> ObjectInputStream:

   -> PipedInputStream:

   -> SequenceInputStream:

   -> StringBufferInputStream:


   b) Output Stream classes



   some notes about implementation of character stream classes:

   a) Reader classes
   -> FileReader: Recommended for reading stream of characters.

   b) Writer classes
