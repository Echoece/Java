There are 4 basic built in primitive data types:

1. Integral - byte (1 byte), short (2 byte), int (4 byte), long (8 bytes)
2. Float - float (4 bytes) , double (8 bytes)
3. Char - 2 bytes, ranges from   0 - 65535
4. Boolean - true or false,

-> default value of everything is 0 and false for boolean.


Variables - variables are used for storing data. In java it must have a data type.

Literals - Literals are constant values that are used in a program.
-> in case of literals we dont have short or byte literals, they all converted to int literals types.
-> to write double, float or long literals we need to use D/d, F/F and L/l after the literal. Example - 12L
-> For character literals, use ''


We can use different number systems as well,
-> Binary representation starts with 0B or 0b and possible chars are [0-1]. for example - 0b1101
-> HexDecimal declaration starts with 0X or 0x and possible chars are [0-9A-Fa-f]. For example - 0xAB6
-> Octal numbers starts with 0 and possible chars are [0-7]. For example - 012


Data types have one signed bit,
    - 0 means positive number
    - 1 means negative number
Negative numbers are always stored as 2's compliment. 1's complement (invert/NOT all bits) + 1 is 2's compliment
