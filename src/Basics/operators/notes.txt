1. ? is a wildcard operator in java, for example if we see
                List<? extends Number> list
    in the generic part, it means any class that extends Number class

2.  :: is also known as reference operator in java.It is used to call a method by referring to it with the help
    of its class directly. They behave exactly as the lambda expressions. The only difference it has from lambda
    expressions is that this uses direct reference to the method by name instead of providing a delegate to the method.

    for example-> To print all elements of the stream
    stream.forEach( s-> System.out.println(s));   // using lambda expression
    stream.forEach( System.out::println(s));      // using colon operator

    Method reference or double colon operator can be used to refer:

    -> a static method,
    -> an instance method, or
    -> a constructor.
