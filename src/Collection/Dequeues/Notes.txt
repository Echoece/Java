Few important points on Priority Queue are as follows:

-> PriorityQueue does’nt permit null.
-> We can’t create PriorityQueue of Objects that are non-comparable
-> PriorityQueue are unbound queues.
-> The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. If multiple elements are tied for least value,
-> the head is one of those elements — ties are broken arbitrarily.
-> Since PriorityQueue is not thread-safe, so java provides PriorityBlockingQueue class that implements the BlockingQueue
   interface to use in java multithreading environment.
-> The queue retrieval operations poll,  remove,  peek, and element access the element at the head of the queue.
-> It provides O(log(n)) time for add and poll methods.
-> It inherits methods from AbstractQueue, AbstractCollection, Collection and Object class
