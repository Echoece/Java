Concurrency :: refers to an application doing more than one thing at a time.

=> every thread created by a process shares that process's memory and files
=> each thread has a thread stack inside the process heap, that only that particular thread can access;

Why we need threads:
-> we sometimes might want to perform a task thats takes long time (query database/read big file/downloading etc). the code
   will pause executing if we use a single thread during these task running.
-> anoher reason maybe that an API requires us to provide one,


we can create thread two ways:
-> extending the Thread class
-> implementing the runnable interface.
it is recommeneded/good practice to implement the runnable interface whenever its possible.


important :: in both cases , we implement the run() method, we dont call it directly. to start a thread we call the start()
             method and this will call the run() in turn and create a new thread for us. if we mistakenly call the run method
             it will not create any thread,  just will run the code in main thread.
