-> In Java date is a long number that contains milliseconds passed since 1st January, 1970
-> Java follows starting year of calender in 1900.

old date API - > Date class from java.util , it  has some property (mutable, contains both date and time, counts
                 milli second) that might be issue.


new Date API -> it is known as joda Date and time API. It has separate class for LocalDate, LocalTIme and LocalDateTime.
                These classes also represent the time since jan 1, 1970. But these classes are immutable. So whenever we change
                we will get a new object of these classes.
