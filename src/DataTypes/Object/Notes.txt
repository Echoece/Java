Object class is the parent class of all java classes. Every class is directly or indirectly inheriting from this class.

Important Methods:
1. clone()      This creates a shallow copy of the object.
2. equals()     checks for equality of two object. This checks for reference equality.
3. finalize()   This is java's version of destructor. But as garbage collector calls this method, we dont need to deal with it.
4. getClass()
5. hashCode()   Every java object will have a unique hashCode given by JVM. We can get that from this method. This is not exact memory location, a hashed value.
6. toString()   returns a String representation of the class. If we try to print an object, it will implicitly call toString method.
7. notify(), notifyAll(), wait(), wait(long timeout), wait(long timeout, int nanosecond) all are used for multithreading
