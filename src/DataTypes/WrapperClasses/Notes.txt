-> Java.lang package contains the wrapper classes.
-> Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double
-> Basically these wrapper classes creates object from primitive types. This process is called Boxing/wrapping over primitive type.

Number class is the parent abstract class of Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double wrapper classes.
It's methods contains byteValue(), doubleValue(), floatValue(), intValue(), longValue(), shortValue() etc. So any number can be converted
to other type.


# To initialize a wrapper class we can use the static valueOf() method, which have several overloads. Or we can directly assign the value.
  We also could use new keyword, but first two is better.
  We can also mention a radix in the valueOf() method, using this we can create different number system like decimal,hex,octal, binary

# different methods are there.
