Following steps are followed for the creation of user-defined Exception.

=>  The user should create an exception class as a subclass of Exception class. Since all the exceptions are subclasses of Exception class,
    the user should also make his class a subclass of it. This is done as:
                 class MyException extends Exception{}

=>  We can write a default constructor in his own exception class.

=>  We can also create a parameterized constructor with a string as a parameter.
    We can use this to store exception details. We can call super class(Exception) constructor from this and send the string there.
                MyException(String str)
                {
                   super(str);
                }

=>  To raise exception of user-defined type, we need to create an object to his exception class and throw it using throw clause, as:
                MyException myException = new MyException(“Exception details”);
                throw myException;
